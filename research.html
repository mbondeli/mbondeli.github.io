    Threats of Violence and Political Ambition: Experimental Evidence </a>

Politicians and candidates for political office are increasingly subject to threats,
harassment and physical violence. Does anticipated exposure to violence affect
political ambition? Leveraging an original survey fielded with US citizens (n = 4582), I
document that concerns about exposure to violence are salient, that Americans on
average overestimate the risk of exposure relative to a scholarly benchmark, and that
overestimation is particularly pronounced among women, queer, and nonwhite citizens.
I then estimate the causal effect of providing corrective aggregate information about
the risk of facing violence in office. Downward-correcting aggregate information has a
small positive effect on individual political ambition, and a large positive effect on
support for the political ambitions of a hypothetical peer. The increase in support for
peer ambition is nearly twice as large for female compared to male peers. My results
highlight concerns about exposure to violence as an important obstacle to diverse
representation.

New democracies often inherit state institutions and key bureaucratic personnel from
past autocratic regimes. How does this legacy influence democratic development? This
paper studies the effect of personnel replacement among police leadership in the state
of Prussia on political life in the Weimar Republic, drawing on original career data on
police officers as well as electoral records. Exploiting variation in the timing of replacement
in a staggered difference-in-differences design, I show that sidelining bureaucrats
associated with the autocratic regime reduced mobilization effort and electoral success of
anti-democratic actors, and lowered the risk of political violence. Qualitative evidence
details how autocratic police leaders leveraged their authority to facilitate violent, antidemocratic
mobilization. My paper highlights the importance of bureaucratic reform in
shaping trajectories of democratization.

Conditional Humanitarianism: Citizen Preferences for Economic Sanctions in Democratic

Economic sanctions are a critical tool of international diplomacy. Existing scholarship shows
that citizens in democratic sender states value sanctions which are effective in producing policy
concessions. However, citizens also seek to limit the adverse humanitarian consequences of
sanction imposition. How do citizens trade off between these objectives? We develop a theory
of sanctions preferences where citizens (i) value policy concessions, (ii) hold humanitarian
motivations, and (iii) hold beliefs about how policy change occurs in autocracies. We argue
that citizens are conditional humanitarians – humanitarian concerns dominate effectiveness
considerations only if policy concessions are unlikely. Results from a preregistered willingness to 
pay experiment examining the preferences of German citizens on sanctions against Russia
after its invasion of Ukraine confirm the predictions of our theory.

Trust the Rich to 'Tax the Rich?' Voter Inferences from Candidate Affluence

This paper investigates how information about candidate affluence shapes voters’
decision-making at the ballot box. Challenging existing arguments that voters prefer
affluent to low-income candidates on competence grounds, I argue that voters use
information on affluence to infer candidate self-interest and evaluate the credibility
of candidates’ policy promises on redistribution. I hypothesize that populist voters
are particularly likely to rely on perceived self-interest as a heuristic for credibility.
Evidence from a candidate-choice conjoint experiment lends partial support to my
argument. While voters dislike affluent candidates for office across the board, populist
voters are particularly reluctant to support wealthy pro-redistribution candidates. My
findings help explain why widespread public support for greater redistribution need
not translate into election victories for left parties.
